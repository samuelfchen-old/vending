# T18A_Group3_Ass_2

Basic design:  
GUI classes pass around a model which contains User data and a connection to the DB  
Model class grabs data from db and does whatever with it before returning a response to the GUI   
Made rough and dirty without OOP in mind cuz I dunno if its worth the effort and this way is   
quick to add new features but please feel free to refactor it to make it not complete puke  
and use actual design instead of this scuffed 2222 adaption

project specs same as last time  
sql is using sqlite3 with a db stored in your Documents directory    
Windows: C:\Users\\%YOUR_USERNAME$\Documents\vending_machine\vending.db  
Linux: /vending_machine/vending.db (probably pls check)  
Mac: dunno
